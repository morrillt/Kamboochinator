# Kamboochinator Project Documentation

Goal: Create a repeatable methodology for building applications as efficiently as possible with AI assistance. We will do this by building out the kambuchinator project.

This is a living project. I am documenting as I go because writing helps me clarify learning :) 

## Documentation Index

1. [Meta / Process Logs](./00-ProjectOverview.md) -Documentation of prompts and methodologies of generating ai instructions and verification processes. **SUPER IMPORTANT** 
2. [Kambuchinator - High Level Specs](./01-MasterPlan.md) - High-level project goals and technical overview of the project
3. [Milestones](./02-Milestones.md) - Project phases and milestone definitions
4. [Packages](./03-Packages.md) - Required libraries and dependencies
5. [Directory Structure](./04-DirectoryStructure.md) - Recommended project organization
6. [Component Specifications](./05-ComponentSpecifications.md) - Detailed component requirements and data schemas
7. [Instruction Generator](./06-InstructionGenerator.md) - Framework for creating incremental development instructions
8. [Milestone 1 Instructions](./07-Milestone1Instructions.md) - AI Executable w/ human in the loop instruction set. Only possible with other 6 docs. **SUPER IMPORTANT**

## Getting Started

To begin working with this project, we recommend following these steps:

1. Read the [Project Overview](./00-ProjectOverview.md) this details the methodology taken so far to execute the master plan.
2. Review the [Master Plan](./01-MasterPlan.md) to grasp the project specs.
3. Examine the [Directory Structure](./04-DirectoryStructure.md) to understand the organization
4. Follow the [Milestone 1 Instructions](./07-Milestone1Instructions.md) to start implementation

## Development Approach

This project uses an incremental, verification-based approach to AI-assisted development. Each milestone is broken down into specific, verifiable steps with clear QA processes to ensure quality and functionality.
