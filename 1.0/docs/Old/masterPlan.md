# ðŸš€ Kamboochanator - Vue Store Prototyping Platform

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goal
Spin up multiple **AI-driven Kombucha store variations** using a common backend/frontend state system (Vue + Vuex). Rapidly test different **UI frameworks, layouts, and generative approaches** to rapid prototyping with the latest ai tools. The main goal is to figure out through experimentation the right approach for ai assisted coding for me.

## concretely:
1. We will make a simple single product store
2. We will remake it several times on different routes with different tech stacks
3. The store is simple it just sells cans of kambucha




## Front end Routes:
/ - an index of all the different variations we will do
/simplecss a route that we make with no component libraries 
/vuetify a route using vuetify
more to be discovered.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Vue.js + vuex (state), we can explore pinia later in the project.
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express.js
- **Database:** just start with a flatfile json file
- **Payments:** Stripe
- **UI Libraries:** Vuetify, open to others lets explore.
