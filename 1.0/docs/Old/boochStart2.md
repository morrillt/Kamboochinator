# Kamboocha - Vue Store Prototyping Platform

## Project Overview
Kamboocha is a rapid prototyping platform for e-commerce store variations. It allows developers to quickly experiment with different store layouts and designs in a single-page application environment.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend Framework**: Vue.js
- **State Management**: Vuex
- **Runtime Environment**: Node.js
- **Development Philosophy**: Simple, step-by-step, easy to understand code

## Project Goals
1. Create a collection of simple, single-page store variations
2. Enable rapid prototyping of different store layouts
3. Provide a central dashboard to preview all store variations
4. Allow quick experimentation with different layouts and designs
