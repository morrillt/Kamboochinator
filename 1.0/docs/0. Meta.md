# Thesis

What I am coming to believe is that perhaps the most important thing in the current state of AI-assisted generative coding is well-structured instructions.

## The Prompt Hierarchy

The key insight is that you need prompts that generate prompts that generate prompts. You could also call these "instructions" rather than prompts.

By spending time writing instructions that build on each other, you end up with essentially a new program - which is the program that programs the AI to build the program.

## The Problem with Current AI Approaches

The current issue with AI is if you ask it to do too much too fast, you get a bunch of crap.

But if you give it considered step-by-step instructions, and if those instructions have:
1. Clear guidance for the AI
2. Instructions for you (the product designer) to efficiently QA what was built

That seems to be the ticket as of today March 14 2025, for the most effiecient way I can see to build non trivial web apps.

## My Approach

In the spirit of that philosophy, this is what I have done so far:
- Created a hierarchy of instructions
- Broken down complex tasks into verifiable steps
- Included QA processes at each stage
- Built documentation that connects these pieces together

# Project Documentation Process

1. Created initial project docs from [masterplan](./Old/masterPlan.md) (original version deleted)
2. Generated [packages](./packages.md) listing required libraries
   - Reviewed and confirmed dependencies looked reasonable
3. Evaluated directory schema options for organization in [directory-structure.md](./2-directory-structure.md)
   - Selected optimal structure based on project goals
   - Moved alternatives to [/Old](./Old/) directory
4. Developed project [milestones.md](./3-milestones.md)
   - Made manual adjustments to align with project goals
5. Created detailed [implementation-steps.md](./4-implementation-steps.md) based on milestones
   - Initially attempted full milestone generation (timed out)
   - Broke down into manageable chunks
6. Reviewed implementation steps
7. Received positive feedback on project structure from GPT
