## Overview
This log documents the steps taken to implement Milestone 1 of the Kamboochinator project, which focuses on creating a basic store with HTML/CSS.

## Date: March 14, 2023

## Steps Completed

### Step 1: Set Up Project Structure
- Created required directories:
  - `src/core/components`
  - `src/variations/simplecss`
  - `src/store/modules`
  - `src/data`
- Enhanced the Vuex store in `src/store/index.js`:
  - Added global state properties (appName, isLoading, error)
  - Added global getters, mutations, and actions
  - Set up module registration

### Step 2: Create Product Data Structure
- Created `products.json` in `src/data` with 3 kombucha styles:
  - Classic Ginger
  - Berry Bliss
  - Citrus Sunrise
- Each product includes:
  - Basic information (name, description, price)
  - Container options (can/bottle)
  - Nutritional information
  - Ingredients
  - Featured and new flags
- Created `productService.js` to handle product data loading:
  - Added method to load products from local data
  - Added method to load products from API with fallback
  - Added method to get a single product by ID
- Enhanced the products Vuex module:
  - Added state for products, loading status, and errors
  - Added getters for all products, featured products, and new products
  - Added mutations to set products, loading state, and errors
  - Added actions to fetch products from local data or API
- Created a directory for product images: `public/images`

### Step 3: Create UI Components
- Updated `App.vue` to:
  - Load products when the application starts
  - Add navigation link to the SimpleCSS route
- Created `ProductList.vue` component to:
  - Display all products with their details
  - Show container options for each product
  - Handle loading and error states
- Updated `HomeView.vue` to:
  - Use the ProductList component
  - Display the app name from the Vuex store

## Next Steps
- Build the /simplecss route with custom styling
- Develop core components (ProductCard, QuantitySelector)

- Styling: CSS with grid layout

## Notes
