i want you to take a at my high level instructions  and get where i am trying to go...

My issue is when i give that to you as a series of instructions you generate too many files and they dont work and its overwhelming.

What i want you to do is make a new set of markdown files

boochstart-step1, step2 step3 step4 step 5


Where i can set incrememental goals and verify as we go if we are on track.

Keep in  mind i am pretty  new  to  vue and i just want to get  in  the  md file two sets of instructions, one to give you to execute, then another set on how to go through the code and troubleshoot assuming it didnt work out of the gates the first time

be excessive in your console.logs and make sure to ask me to verify the console.logs in instructions so we can quickly find differences in expected vs actual console.log series.

In my qa instructions include a table of actual vs expected console.logs


Prompt for Cursor: Incremental Markdown-Based Development Plan
Context
This prompt is for Cursor to generate a structured series of markdown files that guide me step by step in developing a project.

Problem
Historically, when I provide a high-level prompt, Cursor generates an overwhelming number of files that don’t work as intended. The output is difficult to debug, and the process lacks clear checkpoints.

Solution
Instead of a massive, unmanageable output, I want a structured approach:

Generate incremental markdown files named:
boochstart-step1.md
boochstart-step2.md
boochstart-step3.md
boochstart-step4.md
boochstart-step5.md
Each file should focus on one specific, verifiable goal, allowing me to check progress step by step.
Instructions for Each Step
Each markdown file should contain two sections:

Execution Instructions – A set of commands and steps for me to execute.
Troubleshooting & QA – A systematic way to verify output and debug issues.
Debugging & Verification
Include excessive console.log() statements for clarity.
Ask me to verify console logs at key points.
Provide a comparison table for expected vs. actual console outputs.
Example Console Log Verification Table
Step	Expected Console Output	Actual Console Output	Status (✅/❌)
1	App initialized	[user input]	❌
2	Data fetched	[user input]	✅
This method will ensure a smooth, manageable development process while allowing quick identification of issues.

#### **Problem**

#### **Solution**  
Instead of a massive, unmanageable output, I want a structured approach:  

- Generate **incremental markdown files** named:  
  - `boochstart-step1.md`  
  - `boochstart-step2.md`  
  - `boochstart-step3.md`  
  - `boochstart-step4.md`  
  - `boochstart-step5.md`  
- Each file should focus on **one specific, verifiable goal**, allowing me to check progress step by step.  

#### **Instructions for Each Step**

##### **Example Console Log Verification Table**  

| Step | Expected Console Output | Actual Console Output | Status (✅/❌) |  
|------|-------------------------|-----------------------|---------------|  
| 1    | `App initialized`       | `[user input]`        | ❌            |  
| 2    | `Data fetched`          | `[user input]`        | ✅            |
