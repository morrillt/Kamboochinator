# 🚀 Kamboochanator - Vue Store Prototyping Platform

## 🎯 Project Goals


1. Spin up multiple **AI-driven Kombucha store variations** using a common backend/frontend state system (Vue + Vuex).
2. Rapidly test different **UI frameworks, layouts, and generative approaches** to rapid prototyping with the latest AI tools. Determine which is betst.
3. Determine through experimentation the most effective approach for AI-assisted coding for personal workflow.

## Concretely:
1. We will make a simple single product store
2. We will remake it several times on different front end routes with different tech stacks
3. The store is simple it just sells cans of kambucha



## 🛣️ Front End Routes:

| Route | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `/` | An index page showcasing all the different variations |
| `/simplecss` | Implementation using only vanilla CSS (no component libraries) |
| `/vuetify` | Implementation using Vuetify component framework |
| *Additional routes to be added as the project evolves* |

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Vue.js + vuex (state), we can explore pinia later in the project.
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express.js
- **Database:** just start with a flatfile json file, move to mongo mongoose later in project
- **Payments:** Stripe
- **UI Libraries:** Vuetify, open to others lets explore.
